# PolyCat's CHIRP Linux Installer
A python installer script for the popular ham radio programming software [CHIRP](https://chirpmyradio.com) for Linux and MacOS

> [!WARNING]
> I do not have a Mac to test on but since it's [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and python it should work.

## Installation
Download `chirp-install.tar.gz` and extract it. You will find a binary and a `download` folder in the archive. Open the terminal there and run the binary (`./chirp-installer`) and follow the wizard.
